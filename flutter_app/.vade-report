## Vercel Speed Insights Integration

### Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Crave Delivery Flutter web application. This enables performance metric tracking and monitoring through Vercel's Speed Insights dashboard.

### Implementation Details

#### Framework & Project Type
- **Project Type**: Flutter web application
- **Deployment Target**: Vercel
- **Integration Method**: HTML implementation (appropriate for Flutter web)

#### Changes Made

**Modified Files:**
1. `web/index.html` - Added Vercel Speed Insights tracking scripts

**Details:**
- Added the Speed Insights initialization script that creates the `window.si` global function
- Added the deferred Speed Insights script tag that loads from `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
- Both scripts were inserted before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure proper initialization

### Why This Approach

The Crave Delivery project is a Flutter application that compiles to web. Since Flutter generates static HTML/JavaScript output, the HTML implementation of Vercel Speed Insights was the most appropriate choice. This approach:

1. **No additional dependencies**: Flutter doesn't require npm packages for this integration
2. **Minimal changes**: Only modified the web template, keeping the Dart codebase unchanged
3. **Universal compatibility**: Works with any Vercel deployment of the Flutter web app
4. **Automatic tracking**: The script automatically collects Core Web Vitals and performance metrics

### Next Steps for Production

1. **Enable Speed Insights in Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Vercel project's dashboard
   - Navigate to the "Speed Insights" tab
   - Click "Enable" to activate Speed Insights

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - The updated code will enable Speed Insights upon the next deployment
   - Use: `vercel deploy`

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - After deployment, Speed Insights will automatically begin collecting metrics
   - Metrics will be visible in the dashboard after users visit your site
   - Performance data can be tracked over time

### Technical Notes

- The `window.si` function is a fallback that queues any calls made before the Speed Insights script loads
- The `script` tag uses `defer` attribute to ensure scripts load after DOM is ready
- The scripts are positioned before the closing `</body>` tag, which is the standard placement for analytics scripts
- No modifications to Flutter's Dart code were needed as the tracking is purely JavaScript-based

### Files Modified
- `web/index.html` - Added Speed Insights integration scripts

### Verification
- HTML syntax validated successfully
- No build artifacts or dependencies affected
- Ready for deployment to Vercel
